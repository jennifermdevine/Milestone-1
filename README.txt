ABOUT

Lake Elwood was inspired by Lake Mead in Nevada close to Las Vegas. The waters have been at an all-time low and human remains have been found recently, to the point where local law enforcement rewarded those who found any. The fish in this game are native to Lake Mead, the background photo is of Willow Beach, a popular kayaking and fishing spot near Lake Mead, and even the namesake is inspired from Elwood Mead.
